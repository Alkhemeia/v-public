# Welcome to the V Collaborative Space!

Here, you can contribute to various aspects of the game. Whether it's translating game texts into new languages or designing new outfits for your character, you'll find everything you need to bring your ideas to life.

I regularly update the game with the exciting contributions made here, ensuring your creativity becomes a part of our evolving world.

## languages
Here you find the files that contain the language variables. More information about this can be found in the readme.md in the corresponding directory. 

**At this point in time, however, it is not recommended to translate texts because of the likelihood that texts will be removed or completely changed.**

## puppet-part-creation
Here are the files for the game characters. More information about this can be found in the readme.md in the corresponding directory.

## moderation
Here are the files for moderating the game. More information about this can be found in the readme.md in the corresponding directory.
